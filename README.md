# Work

Work is a simple workout-tracking app that lets you easily plan your lifts and view your lifting history. It has a Ruby on Rails back-end and a Javascript front-end.

## Usage
To run Work, fork and clone this repository onto your machine. While in the work-api folder, run the following commands to prepare the database:
$rails db:create
$rails db:migrate

You will also need to run 
$ rails s
while in the work-api directory to get your back-end server running.

From the root directory, run the front end pages on a local server via your preferred method.
